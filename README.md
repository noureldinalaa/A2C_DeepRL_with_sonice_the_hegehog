# A2C_DeepRL_with_sonice_the_hegehog
In this Repository i am trying to use A2C(Deep reinforcement learning) on training an agent which is sonic the hodgehog.
Training sonic was introduced by **OpenAI Retro Contest** and i have used their library in this code to work with the environment.

# This code is based on two implementations :
https://github.com/aborghi/retro_contest_agent  <br/>
https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_einforcement_learning_Course

**reminder** 
Due to depricated functions in tensorflow 2.0 from tensorflow 1.0 i have to edit some functions
